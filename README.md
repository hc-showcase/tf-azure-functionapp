# tf-azure-functionapp

This repo creates a Azure Function app and deploys a Zip file containing a Python application. The Zip file has to be created upfront and stored locally.

## Install tools

* Azure CLI
* Terraform
* 7z

## Login to Azure

Execute ```az login``` and follow the instructions in your browser or ```az login -h``` to see other ways to login.

### Build the Zip

The Zip file must contain the functions and the host.json file in the root. It must not container a root folder.

The Zip must look like that:
```
mkaesz@arch ~/w/tf-azure-funcapp (main)> unzip -l dist.zip
Archive:  dist.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
        0  2020-10-13 11:42   HttpExample/
      751  2020-10-13 11:41   HttpExample/__init__.py
        0  2020-10-13 11:42   HttpExample/__pycache__/
      865  2020-10-13 11:42   HttpExample/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-38.pyc

      117  2020-10-13 11:41   local.settings.json
      109  2020-10-13 11:41   requirements.txt
---------                     -------
     2444                     8 files

```

To build the Zip I used 7z:
```
mkaesz@arch ~/w/tf-azure-functionapp (main)> 
7z a dist.zip ./functions/*

The repository already contains a dist.zip that can be immediately be used without the build step.

### Set your Subscription ID

In main.tf you have to specify the subscription ID you want to use.

### Execute Terraform

```
mkaesz@arch ~/w/tf-azure-functionapp (main)> terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/azurerm...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/random...
- Installing hashicorp/azurerm v2.31.1...
- Installed hashicorp/azurerm v2.31.1 (signed by HashiCorp)
- Installing hashicorp/random v3.0.0...
- Installed hashicorp/random v3.0.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.

* hashicorp/azurerm: version = "~> 2.31.1"
* hashicorp/random: version = "~> 3.0.0"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!



mkaesz@arch ~/w/tf-azure-functionapp (main)> terraform plan
